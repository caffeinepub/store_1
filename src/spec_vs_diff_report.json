  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements successfully, including removal of user accounts (ProfileSetupModal, useUserProfile, account/order history pages), first-user-becomes-admin authentication, homepage hero customization, social media URL management, removal of ShopDropdown, and pill-style category filters. However, Privacy Policy and Terms of Service updates are incomplete or missing critical content verification, and some acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff.",

While the policy mentions 'Admin Authentication' with Internet Identity, it's unclear if all customer-facing Internet Identity and account storage references were removed as the original content is not visible in the diff",
